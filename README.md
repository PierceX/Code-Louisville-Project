# Code-Louisville-Project
Kayaking website
Built this site for a Code Louisville project, this is my first site build. It uses bootstrap and custom css. The custom css is for the colors, jumbtrons, images, and container design.  The top left "Brand" takes you to the home. The nav bar has Home, About, and Contact links for my pages. Also built into the nav bar is a Name and Email capture which is currently not in use.
My site doesnt require anything to run it outside an internet connection.
